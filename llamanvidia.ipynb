The goal is to show that there are infinitely many positive integers n where n² + 1 is divisible by a prime p that is congruent to 1 modulo 4.

But maybe the problem is stronger? Like, maybe n² +1 is divisible by a prime p ≡1 mod 4, but not necessarily that all prime factors are 1 mod 4. The problem says \"some prime p\", so at least one.\n",

      "But the question is to prove that there are infinitely many n such that n² +1 is divisible by at least one prime p ≡1 mod 4. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that there are infinitely many primes p ≡1 mod 4 that divide some n² +1. But the way it's phrased is \"there exists an infinite number of positive integers n such that n² +1 is divisible by some prime p where p ≡1 mod 4.\" So for each such n, there's a prime p≡1 mod4 dividing n² +1, and there are infinitely many such n.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that there are infinitely many primes p≡1 mod4 such that p divides some n² +1. But the problem states \"infinite number of positive integers n\", so the n's are infinite, each having at least one prime factor p≡1 mod4 in their n² +1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the problem is equivalent to saying that the set of numbers of the form n² +1 has infinitely many prime factors congruent to 1 mod4. But the problem is phrased as infinitely many n, each having at least one such prime factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe both interpretations are possible. However, given the problem statement, it's the former: infinitely many n where n² +1 is divisible by some p≡1 mod4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps even stronger: that n² +1 is divisible by a prime p≡1 mod4, and there are infinitely many such n. So, for example, if we can find an infinite sequence of n's where each n² +1 is divisible by some prime p≡1 mod4, possibly different primes for different n's.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to approach this?\n",
      "\n",
      "First, recall that primes p≡1 mod4 can be expressed as the sum of two squares. Also, -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p≡1 mod4. So, for p≡1 mod4, the equation x² ≡ -1 mod p has solutions. Therefore, for such primes, there exists some x with x² ≡ -1 mod p, which implies that p divides x² +1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, for each prime p≡1 mod4, there exists some n (in fact, multiple n's) such that p divides n² +1. So, if we can show that there are infinitely many primes p≡1 mod4, each of which divides some n² +1, then since each such p would correspond to some n, but we need infinitely many n's. However, a single prime p could divide multiple n² +1. For example, p=5 divides 2² +1=5, 3² +1=10, 7² +1=50, etc. So each prime p≡1 mod4 divides infinitely many n² +1. Therefore, if there are infinitely many primes p≡1 mod4, then each of those primes would contribute infinitely many n's. But the problem is to show that there are infinitely many n's such that n² +1 is divisible by at least one p≡1 mod4. Since each prime p≡1 mod4 gives infinitely many n's (as n can be any number congruent to a solution of x² ≡-1 mod p), then if there are infinitely many such primes, the total number of n's would be infinite. But even if there were only finitely many primes p≡1 mod4, each would contribute infinitely many n's, so the total would still be infinite. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem is to prove that there are infinitely many n's. But if even one prime p≡1 mod4 exists, then there are infinitely many n's such that p divides n² +1. For example, take p=5. Then n=2,3,7,8,12,13,... all satisfy n² +1 ≡0 mod5. So there are infinitely many n's for p=5 alone. Therefore, if there's at least one prime p≡1 mod4, then there are infinitely many n's. But the problem is to prove that there are infinitely many n's such that n² +1 is divisible by some p≡1 mod4. Since we already know there are infinitely many n's for a single p≡1 mod4, the statement is trivially true. But that can't be the case, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n",

      "Wait, maybe the problem is to show that there are infinitely many n such that n² +1 is divisible by a prime p≡1 mod4, and that for each such n, the prime p≡1 mod4 is the only prime factor of n² +1, or something else? But the problem doesn't state that. It just says \"divisible by some prime p where p≡1 mod4\". So even if n² +1 has other prime factors, as long as at least one of them is ≡1 mod4, then n counts.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, since for any prime p≡1 mod4, there are infinitely many n with p dividing n² +1, and since there exists at least one prime p≡1 mod4 (like 5), then there are infinitely many n's. Therefore, the problem's statement is trivially true. But that can't be the intended question. Maybe the problem is misstated, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let me check again. The problem says: \"Prove that there exists an infinite number of positive integers n such that n² + 1 is divisible by some prime p where p ≡ 1 mod 4.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But if we take n = 2, 3, 7, 8, 12, 13, etc., all these n's satisfy n² +1 divisible by 5, which is 1 mod4. So there are infinitely many such n's. Therefore, the statement is true, but the proof is trivial because we can just take multiples of the solutions modulo 5. So why would this be a problem to prove? Maybe the actual problem is to show that there are infinitely many n such that n² +1 is a prime ≡1 mod4, but that's a different statement. Or perhaps the problem is to show that there are infinitely many primes p≡1 mod4 that divide some n² +1, which is also true because there are infinitely many primes ≡1 mod4, and each divides some n² +1.\n",

      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe the problem is actually to prove that there are infinitely many n such that n² +1 is divisible by a prime p≡1 mod4, and that this prime p≡1 mod4 is the only prime factor of n² +1 (i.e., n² +1 is a prime power). But that's not what's stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that there are infinitely many primes p≡1 mod4 such that p divides n² +1 for some n. But again, since there are infinitely many primes ≡1 mod4, and each divides some n² +1, that's also true.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the problem as written, I think the intended question might be the latter: to show that there are infinitely many primes p≡1 mod4 that divide some n² +1. But the problem says \"infinite number of positive integers n\", so maybe it's the former.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, rephrased: There are infinitely many n where n² +1 has at least one prime factor congruent to 1 mod4.\n",
      "\n",
      "But as I thought earlier, since 5 divides 2² +1, and 5 divides (2 + 5k)² +1 for any integer k, because (2 +5k)² +1 = 4 + 20k +25k² +1 = 5 + 20k +25k² = 5(1 +4k +5k²), so 5 divides it. Therefore, all numbers of the form 5k +2 will have n² +1 divisible by 5. Therefore, there are infinitely many n (in fact, infinitely many arithmetic progressions) where n² +1 is divisible by 5, which is 1 mod4. Hence, the statement is trivially true.\n",

      "But that seems too easy. Maybe the problem is in another language, and the translation is slightly off. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to prove that there are infinitely many n such that n² +1 is a prime congruent to 1 mod4. That would be a different and more challenging problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to show that there are infinitely many n for which n² +1 has a prime factor ≡1 mod4 that does not divide any smaller n'² +1. But that's speculative.\n",

      "Given the problem as stated, the answer seems trivial because we can take n ≡2 mod5, which gives infinitely many n with 5 dividing n² +1. Hence, there are infinitely many such n. Therefore, the proof is straightforward.\n",
      "\n",
      "But perhaps the intended problem is more nuanced. For example, maybe to show that there are infinitely many n such that n² +1 is divisible by a prime p≡1 mod4, and p does not divide any smaller n'² +1. But that's not stated.\n",

      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that the primes ≡1 mod4 that divide some n² +1 are infinite, which is true because there are infinitely many primes ≡1 mod4, and each divides some n² +1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the problem's exact wording, I think the intended answer is the trivial one, using the fact that 5 divides infinitely many n² +1, hence there are infinitely many n. But that seems too simple for a problem that's supposed to be proved. Maybe the problem is from a context where they haven't covered that primes ≡1 mod4 divide some n² +1, so the proof would involve showing that for each prime p≡1 mod4, there are solutions to x² ≡-1 mod p, hence infinitely many n≡x mod p, leading to infinitely many n.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even so, the existence of one prime p≡1 mod4 (like 5) already gives infinitely many n. Therefore, unless the problem requires that for each n, there's a distinct prime p≡1 mod4, but that's not stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is to show that there are infinitely many n such that n² +1 is not divisible by any prime ≡3 mod4. But that's different.\n",
